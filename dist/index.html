          <p>Public Foods is an online cookbook that hosts recipes from my friends and family. I'm not alone with my love for cooking, so I decided to create a site that allows people to share their favorite recipes.</p>
          <p>Special attention was paid towards ease of use and simplicity for the users. The site allows users to create a profile, and upload recipes all from the frontend of the site.</p>
          <h3>Design Concept</h3>
          <p>Public Foods was designed to be as simple and easy to use as possible. Many of the cooking websites around the web are cluttered and feel claustrophobic. I wanted Public Foods to have a very minimal design with a lot of whitespace.</p>
          <p>I used Sketch to map out each of the three main sections of the site, including the indexes, the recipe upload form, and the recipe layout.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Hi, my name is Travis Miller. I'm a web and UI designer living in Boston. I graduated from Wentworth Institute of Technology in 2010 with a degree in Industrial Design. After graduation, I worked as a furniture designer and woodworker with Bill Bancroft Furniture Design. From there I moved into a role as a design engineer at Design Communications Ltd. I now focus my time on web and user interface design.</p>
          <p>When Iâ€™m not drawing rectangles or writing code, I spend my time making music or helping people build stuff.</p>
          <p>Have a cool project you're working on? I'd love to hear about it.</p>
